# binarian
convert a single GeoJSON vector tile into a single vector-tile-spec vector tile, using vt-pbf and geojson-vt

# usage
```console
$ node index.js https://cyberjapandata.gsi.go.jp/xyz/experimental_landformclassification1/14/14555/6446.geojson
```

# future plan
There might be an express.js proxy and also batch converter. But nobody knows what will happen.
